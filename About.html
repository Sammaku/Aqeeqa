      <h1 > <strong>virtues of <em>Aeeqa</em></strong></h1>
      <br>
      <p>The Aqiqah is a confirmed Sunnah in Islam. It is the sacrifice made for a newborn on the seventh day after birth, and it carries significant virtue in Islamic teachings. The virtues of the Aqiqah include:</p>
      <ul>

        <li> 1. Thanking Allah for the blessing: The Aqiqah is an expression of gratitude to Allah for the blessing of a newborn child.</li>
        <br>
        
        <li> 2. Drawing closer to Allah: By offering the Aqiqah, a person is drawing closer to Allah by following the teachings of the Prophet.</li>
        <br>
        
        <li> 3.  Protection for the child: According to some hadiths, the Aqiqah protects the child from harm and the influence of Satan.</li>
        <br>
        
        <li> 4. Spreading joy and sharing: It is recommended to distribute the meat of the Aqiqah to family, friends, and the needy, fostering a sense of community and love among people.</li>
        <br>
        
        <li> 5. Forgiveness of sins: In some narrations, it is mentioned that the Aqiqah can be a means for the forgiveness of sins and the removal of hardship.</li>
        <br>
        <p>The Sunnah is to sacrifice two sheep for a boy and one for a girl, but this is not obligatory. If someone cannot afford two, they may offer one even for a boy.</p>
      </ul>
